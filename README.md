# Blood-compatibility




Blood components:

-Red blood cells(RBC)
-White blood cells/Platelets
-Plasma


RBC has antigens on the surface of the cell and if they come into contct with antibodies inside the plasma it will produce an imunological reaction called aglutination




Blood is a tissue even if it has a liquid form and just like any other transplant it is necessary to prepare the donors and recievers according to the most modern clinical guides.
