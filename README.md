Distinct molecules called agglutinogens (a type of antigen) are attached to the surface of red blood cells. There are two different types of agglutinogens, type "A" and type "B". Each type has different properties. The ABO blood type classification system uses the presence or absence of these molecules to categorize blood into four types.


Blood is a tissue even if it has a liquid form and just like any other transplant it is necessary to prepare the donors and recievers according to the most modern clinical guides.
