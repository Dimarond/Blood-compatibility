# Blood-compatibility


This project is a building block for a future web-app that implememts these scripts.




Blood components:

-Red blood cells(RBC)

-White blood cells/Platelets

-Plasma

Blood donor compatibility is an important aspect of blood transfusion, where blood from a donor is given to a recipient to treat various medical conditions. Compatibility is determined by the blood types of both the donor and the recipient, with each blood type having specific antigens and antibodies that can cause an immunological reaction if not matched correctly. ABO and Rh are the two most important blood group systems used in determining compatibility, with a total of eight blood types: O-, O+, A-, A+, B-, B+, AB-, and AB+. It is crucial to match the donor and recipient blood types to prevent dangerous immunological reactions, which can be fatal if not managed properly.

 


Inheritance and genetic components:


The inheritance of blood type is determined by the genes inherited from both parents. Each person inherits two copies of the gene for blood type, one from each parent. The A and B genes are dominant, while the O gene is recessive. This means that a person with AB blood type inherited one copy of the A gene and one copy of the B gene, while a person with O blood type inherited two copies of the O gene. 



In confirming genetic offspring, blood type can be a useful tool. A child's blood type can only be one of the blood types that the parents have. For example, if both parents have O blood type, then their child must have O blood type as well. However, if one parent has A blood type and the other has B blood type, their child could have either A, B, AB or O blood type, depending on which genes were inherited. Blood type alone cannot confirm paternity or maternity, but it can help to rule out certain possibilities. Other genetic testing such as DNA testing may be required for confirmation.
