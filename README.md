# Blood-compatibility




Blood components:

-Red blood cells(RBC)
-White blood cells/Platelets
-Plasma

Blood donor compatibility is an important aspect of blood transfusion, where blood from a donor is given to a recipient to treat various medical conditions. Compatibility is determined by the blood types of both the donor and the recipient, with each blood type having specific antigens and antibodies that can cause an immunological reaction if not matched correctly. ABO and Rh are the two most important blood group systems used in determining compatibility, with a total of eight blood types: O-, O+, A-, A+, B-, B+, AB-, and AB+. It is crucial to match the donor and recipient blood types to prevent dangerous immunological reactions, which can be fatal if not managed properly.



Blood is a tissue even if it has a liquid form and just like any other transplant it is necessary to prepare the donors and recievers according to the most modern clinical guides.
